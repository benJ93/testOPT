Develop optimisation with R
The scope of this work is to write a code with R and the library nloptr in order to solve a non linear optimization problem with constraints.
This programm will be a usefull tool to help planning analysts to solve the economic dispatch problem.
The problem of economic dispatch is about determine the output of each power generator in a power system with the lowest cost.
